Readme

Our grassroots organization located in Jiman√≠, Dominican Republic is using GitHub as a way to faciliate transparent and open collaboration between our members and partners. 

COTEDEMI has been in operation since February of 2013  to build job opportunities, entrepreneurship and to provide financial services to its members. The majority of our mebers are refugee women affected by the 2010 Earthquake in Haiti. We are creating a better future for ourselves and our families by working together and with trusted partners. We provide culturally and linguistically sensitive programs that focus on business development and financial savings.
 
As an Open Source project, we share all of our history and information in this publically shared repository so that we can edit, update and manage group documents with our partners.
