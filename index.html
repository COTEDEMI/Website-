Who are your partners? 
 
In conjunction with Banco ADOPEM's  "community banking” product, we are assisting undocumented migrants a formal way to save, borrow and have access to workshops in the areas of financial literacy, entrepreneurship, health and education.

Since a majority of local organizations provide traditional refugee services that fail to foster economic independence and self­ sustainability, many refugees become dependent on relief organizations. Our approach is to engage leaders and local stakeholders to become part of the social­innovation processes. Our approach is build an inclusive, bottoms­up strategy with local knowledge and talented mentors that will drive entrepreneurship and innovation at the border.

Hands­on methodology that engages women through local workshops, cultural events and group activities promoting idea sharing and alternative ways of thinking
Organizing hackathons, entrepreneurial challenges and innovation camps

Using Internet and social media to create international and national campaigns of awareness and connect with global initiatives
Using digital platforms that present innovative tools and services available to move forward: Crowdfunding, marketplaces and B2B platforms.

Legal status is a powerful element that provide individuals with the ability to travel safely and earn more money, thereby lowering rates of poverty. Unlike the United States, the DR does not grant citizenship to children who are born to undocumented parents. Currently hundreds of thousands of individuals of Haitian descent are denied access to affordable health services, basic legal protections and the right to vote. In Jimaní all children are allowed to attend primary school however once they reach middle school, they are required to provide proper documentation. If documentation is not available their education ends. Our program helps families whose children are dependent on documentation to attend school.

We are serving 95 women and 130 of their dependents and believe that our model provides families a trusted place to save for this documentation. We have the potential of assisting 1,000 families to become integrated, visible and active members of Dominican society.

		<div>As a result of the 2010 Earthquake, an estimated 200,000 Haitians fled to the DR in search of medical assistance, employment and relief from post­disaster conditions. The Haitian women with whom we work are oftentimes subjected to extortion and physical and sexual violence, and earn an average of $2.50/day. Without proper legal documentation, they are denied employment and relegated to a never­ending cycle of poverty. We assist women to adjust their status by securing proper documentation.
